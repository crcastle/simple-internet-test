##WTF?##
**This is a simple Python web app plus zsh shell script to test whether the internet connection is down.**

------------------------------
##Why?##
I was tired of hearing people ask, *"is the internet down?"*

Now they can look at this webpage and say, *"Fuckface, the internet is down.  Go fix it so I can get some work done!"* (or keep their mouths shut if the internet is not really down).

---------------------------------
##What?##
It does some pinging of the google at 8.8.8.8, averages the return-trip time over three pings, and summarizes the result in a pretty web page.

------------------------------------------
##How?##
I'm tired right now so I'm not going to nicely spell out how to install this.  It uses zsh, ping, Python 2.7, and web.py.

Your sysadmin should be able to figure out how to get it working.  If they can't, then give them a high five, to the face, with a chair.
